## Developing Software since 2008

Hey there. I am Tobias S. Keller and am developing software since 2008. Back   then smaller projects in PHP, now bigger and more reliable stuff, mainly in   node.js/ typescript on AWS. For smaller side-projects I sometimes also use   python or c/c++ (for arduino/ esp8266 development).

### Most relevant (public) repositories and projects

I regularly write new software for my own projects, such as tools or   automations to simplify my daily life, or to help me or friends with my job or   hobbies. Most of these projects will never make it on the list above as they   are not matured enough to be published, or are too specific to be useful for   others. Some examples include:

- Some smart home automations in nodejs, e.g. a tool that fetches calendar     entries from my calendar and sends them to my smart home system

- a hardware controller to control the lighting and sound sources in an event     venue

- A LaTeX class for formatting the[book](https://www.tobisk.de/deadline), I've written or my CV

- THIS tool (A tool that generates my GitHub Readme based on an HTML file)

### Further Interests

as you probably see in the software projects I am developing, I am interested   in musical and theatrical arts and event technology, such as music production,   deejaying, designing lightshows and streaming productions.

### My Principles:

I try to start a new project at least every quarter and invest at least 1-2   days in it. Always trying new ideas or new technologies, let it be some   framework or a new hobby. If it sounds promising, I'll keep working on it, if   not I'll ditch it.

Projects that came from this Principle: Servobill, KUVO-Proxy, ToskLight,   Rekbordboy-To-Music as well as many other unnamed projects. I started this   habit in Spring 2020.

### Past projects

- wordpress plugin for the TU Darmstadt theatre club to manage their     productions and team members https://www.tud-schauspielstudio.de/technik/

- software written in meteorjs with a custom connector to MySQL and LDAP for     user management of the abovementioned theatre club

- bachelors project: creation of worksheets for math classes (web based     application that uses latex in the backend to generate the sheets as PDF)

- **[KUVO-Proxy](https://github.com/kellertobias/kuvo-proxy),       written for my own DJ streams in 2021**: Get your Playing Tracks out of your Rekordbox in Performance mode in     real-time. Implements a catchall proxy that translates he calls from     rekordbox to KUVO to a realtime webpage for embedding into video-streams or     doing other stuff with it. Sadly Rekordbox dropped support for KUVO, so it     doesn't work anymore
