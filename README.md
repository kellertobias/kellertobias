## Developing Software since 2008
Hey there. I am Tobias S. Keller and am developing software since 2008. Back then smaller projects in PHP, now bigger and more reliable stuff, mainly in node.js. For smaller side-projects I sometimes also use python or c (for arduino/ esp8266 development).

### Most relevant repositories and projects

- [**blink.it**](https://www.blink.it), a Learning Management System, which is also a authoring tool  
  (I am working there as lead software architect - by the way: we are hiring https://www.blink.it/jobs)
- [**Rekordbox to Apple Music**](https://github.com/kellertobias/rekordbox-to-music-playlists):  
  A tool for DeeJays working with Rekordbox on the Mac to transfer their Playlists back from Rekordbox to Apple Music  
  (Status: Beta - UI and Production Builds Missing)
- [**ArtNET to OBS**](https://github.com/kellertobias/artnet-to-obs):  
  Use OBS as a Media-Server for Playing Videos, Images and Music on a Screen, Projector, etc. on a Stage, controlled by your Lighting desk  
  (Status: Alpha)
- [**ToskStudio**](https://github.com/kellertobias/tosk-studio):  
  Control Suite for Blackmagic ATEM Mixers and OBS for Video Streaming including Tallies, Text Generators and the required hardware
  (Status: Beta)
- [**KUVO-Proxy**](https://github.com/kellertobias/kuvo-proxy):  
  Get your Playing Tracks out of your Rekordbox in Performance mode in real-time. Implements a catchall proxy that translates he calls from rekordbox to KUVO to a realtime webpage for embedding into video-streams or doing other stuff with it  
  (Status: Production)

- [**ToskLight**](https://github.com/kellertobias/tosklight)  (PRIVATE PROJECT)
  a Lighting Control Software similar to MA's GrandMA 2/ Dot2, meant for smaller clubs or theatres  
  at the moment, this project is not jet public as it only contains as simple Proof-Of-Concept

### Skills and used Technologies

- typescript
- node.js
- react
- AWS
- coffeescript (used for former projects, since 2018 gradually replaced with typescript)
- less developed skills: webpack, jest

### Further Interests

as you probably see in the software projects, I am developing, I am interested in musical and theatrical arts and event technology, such as music production, deejaying, designing lightshows and streaming productions.

### My Principles:

I try to start a new project at least every month and invest at least 2-3 Hours in it. Always trying new ideas or new technologies, let it be some framework or a new hobby. If it sounds promising, I'll keep working on it, if not I'll ditch it. Projects that came from this Principle: KUVO-Proxy, ToskLight, Rekbordboy-To-Music as well as many other unnamed projects. I started this habit in Spring 2020.
