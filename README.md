## Developing Software since 2008
Hey there. I am Tobias S. Keller and am developing software since 2008. Back then smaller projects in PHP, now bigger and more reliable stuff, mainly in node.js. For smaller side-projects I sometimes also use python or c (for arduino/ esp8266 development).

### Most relevant repositories and projects

- **blink.it**, a Learning Management System, which is also a authoring tool (My main job: https://www.blink.it - we are hiring ;) )
- **Rekordbox to Apple Music**: A tool for DeeJays working with Rekordbox on the Mac to transfer their Playlists back from Rekordbox to Apple Music (mostly finished, UI missing: https://github.com/kellertobias/rekordbox-to-music-playlists)
- **ArtNET to OBS**: Use OBS as a Media-Server for Playing Videos, Images and Music on a Screen, Projector, etc. on a Stage, controlled by your Lighting desk (Work in Progress, Most important features are present: https://github.com/kellertobias/artnet-to-obs)
- **ToskStudio**: Control Suite for Blackmagic ATEM Mixers and OBS for Video Streaming including Tallies, Text Generators and the required hardware (Mostly done:  https://github.com/kellertobias/tosk-studio)
- **KUVO-Proxy**: A Catchall Proxy that translates he calls from rekordbox to KUVO to a realtime webpage for embedding into video-streams or doing other stuff with it (Mostly done: https://github.com/kellertobias/kuvo-proxy)

### Work in Progress:

- a Lighting Control Software similar to MA's GrandMA 2/ Dot2, meant for smaller clubs or theatres (Project is Private for now)

### Skills and used Technologies

- typescript
- node.js
- react
- AWS
- coffeescript (used for former projects, since 2018 gradually replaced with typescript)
- less developed skills: webpack, jest

### Further Interests

as you probably see in the software projects, I am developing, I am interested in musical and theatrical arts and event technology, such as music production, deejaying, designing lightshows and streaming productions.
