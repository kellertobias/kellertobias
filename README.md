## Developing Software since 2008
Hey there. I am Tobias S. Keller and am developing software since 2008. Back then smaller projects in PHP, now bigger and more reliable stuff, mainly in node.js. For smaller side-projects I sometimes also use python or c (for arduino/ esp8266 development).

### Skills and used Technologies

- ![](/tech-ts.png) TypeScript: Configuring the Compiler, Writing Typed software in TypeScript, Generics, etc.
- ![](/tech-node.png) node.js: Writing Software in NodeJS (Started back in 2015 on top of meteor.js, written core-monkey-patches, newer projects since 2018 without meteor) 
- ![](/tech-react.png) react.js: started back when it was common to write class style components, now writing hooks, HOCs and Functional Components in TSX
- ![](/tech-aws.png) Amazon AWS: using for main job, regularly using CloudFormation/ CDK, Docker/Fargate, Loadbalancing, S3, CloudWatch, now also API Gateway and AppSync
- ![](/tech-mongo.png) MongoDB: Using in Combination with meteor since 2015
- coffeescript (used for former projects, since 2018 gradually replaced with typescript)
- less developed skills: webpack, jest, electron (can use these technologies, using them sometimes, but still struggeling here and there)

### Further Interests

as you probably see in the software projects, I am developing, I am interested in musical and theatrical arts and event technology, such as music production, deejaying, designing lightshows and streaming productions.

### My Principles:

I try to start a new project at least every month and invest at least 2-3 Hours in it. Always trying new ideas or new technologies, let it be some framework or a new hobby. If it sounds promising, I'll keep working on it, if not I'll ditch it. Projects that came from this Principle: KUVO-Proxy, ToskLight, Rekbordboy-To-Music as well as many other unnamed projects. I started this habit in Spring 2020.
