<h2>Developing Software since 2008</h2>
<p>
  Hey there. I am Tobias S. Keller and am developing software since 2008. Back
  then smaller projects in PHP, now bigger and more reliable stuff, mainly in
  node.js/ typescript on AWS. For smaller side-projects I sometimes also use
  python or c/c++ (for arduino/ esp8266 development).
</p>

<h3>Further Interests</h3>
<p>
  as you probably see in the software projects I am developing, I am interested
  in musical and theatrical arts and event technology, such as music production,
  deejaying, designing lightshows and streaming productions.
</p>

<h3>My Principles:</h3>
<p>
  I try to start a new project at least every quarter and invest at least 1-2
  days in it. Always trying new ideas or new technologies, let it be some
  framework or a new hobby. If it sounds promising, I'll keep working on it, if
  not I'll ditch it.
</p>
<p>
  Projects that came from this Principle: Servobill, KUVO-Proxy, ToskLight,
  Rekbordboy-To-Music as well as many other unnamed projects. I started this
  habit in Spring 2020.
</p>

<h3>Past projects</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    wordpress plugin for the TU Darmstadt theatre club to manage their
    productions and team members https://www.tud-schauspielstudio.de/technik/
  </li>
  <li>
    software written in meteorjs with a custom connector to MySQL and LDAP for
    user management of the abovementioned theatre club
  </li>
  <li>
    bachelors project: creation of worksheets for math classes (web based
    application that uses latex in the backend to generate the sheets as PDF)
  </li>
  <li>
    <b
      ><a href="https://github.com/kellertobias/kuvo-proxy">KUVO-Proxy</a>,
      written for my own DJ streams in 2021</b
    >: Get your Playing Tracks out of your Rekordbox in Performance mode in
    real-time. Implements a catchall proxy that translates he calls from
    rekordbox to KUVO to a realtime webpage for embedding into video-streams or
    doing other stuff with it. Sadly Rekordbox dropped support for KUVO, so it
    doesn't work anymore
